Updated Phonegap plugin from
https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iOS/MapKit

Now it works with phonegap 2.6

To use it drag all the .h and .m files to your Xcode plugins folder

Add this line to your config.xml
<plugin name="MapKitView" value="MapKitView" />

NOTE: It doesn't workt with phonegap 2.7, there is a phonegap 2.7 version here https://github.com/imhotep/MapKit/tree/master/src/ios
