The code is based on the one on this thread

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/677530/how-can-i-programmatically-get-the-mac-address-of-an-iphone

It returns an array of network interface objects. Each object have a "name", "macAddress" and "ip"
In my test (iPad and simulator)
lo0 (127.0.0.1 IP and 00:00:00:00:00:00 mac address)
en0 (is the wifi with the local IP and the wifi mac address)

I think on iPhones it should return another network interface for 3G chipset but I can't test.

There is a sample project and the sample code inside the index.html
