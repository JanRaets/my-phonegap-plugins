The code is based on the one on this stack overflow thread. All the credit goes to him. I just created the plugin with that code.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/677530/how-can-i-programmatically-get-the-mac-address-of-an-iphone

It returns an array of network interface objects. Each object have a "name", "macAddress" and "ip" properties
In my test (iPad and simulator) I got 2 network interfaces:

lo0 (127.0.0.1 IP and 00:00:00:00:00:00 mac address)
en0 (is the wifi with the local IP and the wifi mac address)

I think on iPhones it should return another network interface for 3G chipset but I can't test.

There is a sample project and the sample code inside the index.html


How to use:

Drag the IPAddress.c, IPAddress.h, NetworkInterfacesPlugin.m and NetworkInterfacesPlugin.h to your Xcode project

add this line to the config.xml

 <plugin name="NetworkInterfacesPlugin" value="NetworkInterfacesPlugin" />

copy the NetworkInterfacesPlugin.js inside your www folder and link to it in your index.html
